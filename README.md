# YetAnotherTodo (year 2013 - now)

I am learning on this project light technologies (Nancy, SisoDB, AngularJS, Bootstrap). Trying to use Lazy/Programming Motherfucker approach. I am moving from Nancy to AngularJS. Step by step changing the app to generate markup on the client instead of server.

## Playground

I use this app as a playground for other approaches, libraries, etc that I need to use in a daily work. E.g: psake, VS2017 template, updating libraries with braking changes, updating to newest nuget configs.

## Idea for an app

Write down your 'Notes'. Organize them into 'Topics' (Categories). Classical dogfooding everybody needs from time to time.

## Example
